This example demonstrates an automated Python script designed to scrape rental listings in San Francisco from Zillow (https://www.zillow.com/), using BeautifulSoup and Selenium WebDriver. This approach captures dynamic content, adapting to HTML changes on the site by adjusting element names when needed, making it robust to Zillow's frequent page updates.

The script is fully automated, navigating Zillow’s listings page to gather key rental details—such as price, address, and listing links—for convenient collection and analysis.

Additionally, rental data can be seamlessly entered into a Google Form for further processing or storage. For instance, a sample Google Form, linked below, could be customized to log details from each listing: Example form: https://forms.gle/WXAvhwf3mN4rqBtc7
